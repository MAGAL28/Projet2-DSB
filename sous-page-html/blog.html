		<h3>SECK Serigne</h3>
		<p>
			Hello, I am SECK Serigne, I study computer science in the faculty of sciences Rennes1 more precisely at ISTIC. I am really happy to get this opportunity to give my opinion about on-campus, local or global environmental issues that affect me. 
			Firstly, I think we don’t always realize how lucky we are to be in live with thousands and thousands of possibilities to make our daily life better than now. For example, I see each day one the campus too much cars and, in my opinion, I think it will be more ecological to create self-electric driving cars with which we will be able to provide travel in the campus. Therefore, we decrease our co2 rate. By the way, I would like to talk about trash can, we don’t have enough of it. Sometime I see some students throw garbage on the floor because they don’t see dustbin around them. I am not trying to justify this behavior but it just for saying about the urgency of the need.  
			What’s more I cannot understand why they always give us lessons on paper.  Nowadays we have technologies for watching or taking note why always stripper of papers? I can see some of my lector saying like: “some people don’t have laptop or access to the technologies” Yes, I couldn’t agree more, however we can give papers only this people and not everyone in the classroom, this is my solution.

		<h3>ARIANE</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Ariane Nicolas, I’m a student on the campus of Beaulieu, and I enjoy being part of it. Indeed, it is involved in the topic of the environment and allows us to try making a better world at our scale. During the last few weeks, I discovered many initiatives made by students to create a campus greener and more ecological.
			For example, there is a shared garden, where students can plant what they want and create a little green space with beautiful plants! There is also a small forest which has just been planted a few months ago. It is fundamental to turn our planet green again, especially knowing how we deforested it in the last few years. Indeed, the Amazonian forest, which is the greatest vegetation surface in the world, is decreasing by 10 000 square kilometers each year. We cannot keep on destroying our planet like that!
			I am ready to make our planet green again, beginning with our campus of Beaulieu!

		<h3>SIMPARA Ibrahim </h3>
		<p>
			Hello, my name is Ibrahim Kalilou Simpara and I am a student in L2-Miage at the University of Rennes 1. I discovered the Har Vuhez association through a friend who is part of the association. Ar Vuhez is a student and college association for environmental awareness. It encourages the exchange of knowledge, skills and experience. It's only been two years since I came to the University of Rennes 1. And I can say that the association really contributes to maintaining a holy environment within the university. I can only say positive things about the Har Vuhez association because it also allows students to flourish, to launch a project, to speak openly and to be listened to.
